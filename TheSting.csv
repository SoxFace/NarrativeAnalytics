throw away the champagne - character detail
oblique shots -- not cetnral
00:14:30 Lonnergan learns about the missing money
given'em too much time to think
Who you rootin' for, anyway?
shows hierarchy - each level makes the top guy appear more powerful
a class grifter - that's Hooker's aim
there's always a depression
00:20:05 Snyder tells Hooker he's stolen from Lonnergan, fixer?, point of attack
sNyder never gets anything first

possibly Gondroff drank last night because 
I've known him since I was six

I dont know enough about killin
sound of train -- important
needs to learn healthy fear

Sequences: titles
first grift - inciting incident - ends with Hooker blowing his win
Lonnegan's wrath - point of attack

Out and up, huh?
You always look for the back, kid.

the trick of making him feel like he should have doubted, then giving it to him despite his doubts -- inspires more trust

you can't play your friends like marks

Alva Coleman - the call-back to the first reel

If you come in before we play him, I'll kill him

long silence - painful

Chicago was a fixed 
no sense in being a grifter if it's the same as being a citizen

Revenge is for suckers.
Why you doing it. "Seems worth while, don't it."
